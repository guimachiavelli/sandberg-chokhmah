> Chokhmah is associated in the soul with the power of intuitive insight, flashing lightning-like across consciousness.

> The "wisdom" of Chokhmah also implies the ability to look deeply at some aspect of reality and abstract its conceptual essence till one succeeds in uncovering its underlying axiomatic truth. 

> Seeds of truth

> Wisdom comes from nothingness

# Initial idea
I really like the idea of lightning flying across the screen. Perhaps the user needs to watch those flashes of light to solve the puzzle? What is the puzzle, though?

A rhythm game in which the user needs to press a button (any button?) as the screen flashes to stabilise the flux?

# Proof-of-concept conclusions
The proof-of-concept prototype I came up with this afternoon works as such: on a black background, white curves flash regularly. By pressing buttons on the keyboard, the screen flashes with a random colour and makes a sound depending on the pressed key. If a button is pressed whilst the white curves are flashing, the screen goes white for a second or two.

I can see a few possible improvements:
* associate sounds with each curve;
* show only one curve at a time;
* once someone matches a curve, it stays on screen;
* once all curves are matched, the game ends;
* bonus: movement detection -- instead of using keyboards, use the built-in camera to detect movement (more of a boolean thing at first, potentially getting a bit more input on location or speed of movement)

The mechanics sort of work and I think they build up on the previous poem, keter (where it was just a click). 

Not that sure how the wisdom comes from nothingness part ties int here. The conclusion must somehow enlighten the user/player. Perhaps I can craft a pleasant song made out of each line, and that when one finally gets everything together they play and sing for some time. It seems to satisfy an abstract representation of wisdom (don't want to get too specific about the interpretation/meaning of wisdom here).

I like the idea that even mistakes have an outcome that is not wholly unpleasant and think it's somehow crucial here: boring games have only one correct answer, interesting games, in my opinion, are generous and unpredictable.
